# Food Delivery App Data Analysis
In this project, a real-world dataset from Zomato, one of the most widely used food ordering platforms, was worked on. The objective of the project was to clean the dataset, analyze the provided data, and extract insights of informational quality.

## Project Description
This project will help you understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using python for better upcoming performance, and how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database.

## Module 1 - Data Preprocessing
In this module, you will query the dataset using structured query language to gain insights from the database. The problem statements to be solved will be provided to you, and you will need to provide the solution for the same using your logic. Different concepts of SQL will be used in this process, such as aggregating the data, grouping the data, ordering the data, etc

## Module 2 - Data Analysis Using SQL
In this module, you will be working on performing data analysis on the pre-processed data from the previous module and conducting Data Analysis using SQL. You will generate queries for given problem statements.
